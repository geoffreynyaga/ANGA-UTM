For windows installation, kindly check out the official Django documentation to install GEOS and GDAL libraries and how to configure them. Alternatively, I can recommend you install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and use the Ubuntu environment inorder to install the dependacies using the steps below Steps Clone the repo git clone https://github.com/geoffreynyaga/ANGA-UTM.git create a python virtualenvironment virtualenv venv activate the virtualenvironment source venv/bin/activate install python packages pip install -r requirements.txt install geojango Geospatial Libraries packages sudo apt-get install binutils libproj-dev gdal-bin create a postgres database on called \"anga_utm\" or equivalently give it a custom name and make sure to change the value in the local.py settings file run migrations python manage.py migrate create superuser python manage.py createsuperuser log in to the admin and under \"Authentication and Authorization\" create a group called CAA and give the group the relevant permissions that Civil Aviation requires e.g. changing reserved airspaces, adding/changing NOTAMs One more thing... By default, the application is country-specific, and the default country is Kenya, but this constraint can be removed. If you log in the app, the map will awlays be bound to Kenyan borders. To cahnge this to another country, draw a box on Google maps/earth that covers the entire country of your choice. Then get the North East lattitude/longitude as well as South Eastern lat/long of the bounding box An example for Kenya can be seen in the image below Finally, take those values and insert them in applications/templates/applications/airspaces.html in this line bounds = new L.LatLngBounds(new L.LatLng(<northEastLatitude>,<northEastLongitude>), new L.LatLng(<southWestlattitude>, <southWestLongitude>)); Now the app should be working well. However, you will realise that you can not create a reserve airspace yet, and that you have to have an RPAS registered, which when you attempt does not go through because you are not registered to any organisation. This is a deliberate design choice, you have to register an organisation on the admin page http://localhost:8000/admin and add the user to that organisation. This is the supposed role that Civil Aviation bodies will have to play. Finally, you can create a user in the admin page and make sure to assign them to the CAA group that we created in on of the steps above. If you now login with this user on the site, you should have additional features such as Approve Flight Plans , Create Notams etc.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#anga-utm","text":"This is a LAANC (Low Altitude Authorization and Notification Capability) to UTM (UAV Traffic Management) implemetation for drones / UAS / RPAS.

STEP 1 RPAS / UAS REGISTRATION The user first enters the general useful information on the RPAS i.e the Serial number, its actual picture (that helps identify it for example in case of incident) and RPAS nickname to help the pilot recognize the RPAS amongst his/her own fleet of similar RPAS. The user is also requested to selt an organization that also helps to tie the RPAS to a specific ROC, RTO, private, Club or recreational categories. Step 2: More Detailed Information The various components that make up an RPAS are also individually registered and associated with a specific RPAS. For example: Battery serial and manufactuer for enterprise drones that require frequent battery changes. This also helps in subsequent battery logs in flight plans. Manufacturer database for RPAS, payloads and other accessories. Payload model types e.g RGB, Infra-red, multispectral for agriculture, EO etc. This classification can help in regulating where certain drones cant fly. Etc. Payload registration For example, when registering a payload for a certain RPAS, the user I prompted to provide information about the Manufacturer, the payload model type(e.g Infra-red), payload serial, payload weight etc. Personnel Registration and Profiles The personnel profile (available to be seen by all users) provides a list of the following: Pilot details Pilot contacts The company they work for However, CAA can be able to also see the following additional information: Flight history Rated aircrafts Hours done RPAS owned by the pilot Home address. Organization Registration NB: This registration can only be done by an authorized staff from CAA. As per regulation, the following options are available in organization registration: ROC PRIVATE RTO CLUB RECREATIONAL RPAS Training Organisations have also been separated from ROCs due to the following factors: Most pilots registered here will be student pilots with no license Training school will be under \u201cgreen zones\u201d of flying where authorizations might be given automatically if flying inside the school premises. In case of other pilots flying nearby or in same airspace, they will know there are student flights near them for safety awareness. The green zones concept will also be applied to RC Club premises.
