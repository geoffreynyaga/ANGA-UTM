## My Postholds

In this category, the user can be able to see his designated postholds in the company or in multiple companies (i.e. in the case where a pilot does flying for multiple companies or for individuals who own multiple companies.)

## Flight Logs.

This portion shows all flight logs associated with the company. The accountable manager and any other selected management personnel can view all company logs but pilots can only see their logs.
